# Goethe Institute Vocabulary Repository

Welcome to the Goethe Institute Vocabulary Repository! This repository contains tab-separated value (TSV) files for German vocabulary at levels A1, A2, and B1.

## File Structure

The vocabulary is organized by level and alphabet. Each file contains vocabulary words for a specific letter of the alphabet. The structure is as follows:


- **`a1/`**: Vocabulary for the A1 level
- **`a2/`**: Vocabulary for the A2 level
- **`b1/`**: Vocabulary for the B1 level

Each file (e.g., `a1/a.tsv`) contains tab-separated vocabulary words and arranged alphabetically.
